# ActionScript and Flex Project Tools

A collection of utility scripts for working with ActionScript and Flex projects.

The `as-docp` tool is a utility that can be used to generate a flex config file 
from package level ASDoc files. For each package you want to document place your
asdoc comments in a file with a .asdoc suffix. The `as-docp` tool can then be
used to gather these together in a flex-config.xml file to pass to the asdoc 
tool when building your documentation.

The `as-manifest` tool can be used to generate a flex manifest file for a given
source tree.
